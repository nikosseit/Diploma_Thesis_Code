This repository contains the code for my diploma thesis, which presents an assistive system developed to help users efficiently locate their last focus point within multi-window environments. Implemented in Python with PostgreSQL integration, the system processes and filters real-time gaze data from an eye-tracking device using a custom-developed algorithm, accurately predicting the user's last point of visual engagement. This project highlights my work in human-computer interaction, focusing on solutions that enhance user experience through live data processing and adaptive focus point identification, meeting the challenges of real-time accuracy in dynamic interface management.
